\title{Compute Sliding Window Average}
\usage{
slide_window_average(ratio = NULL, window = 7, step = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{ratio}{A numeric vector containing the data for which the sliding window average is to be calculated.}

\item{window}{An integer specifying the size of the sliding window. Default is \code{7}.}

\item{step}{An integer specifying the step size for moving the window across the vector. Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric vector of the same length as the input \code{ratio}, where each value corresponds
to the sliding window average. Boundary regions (near the start and end) retain their original values.
}
\description{
This function computes the sliding window average of a numeric vector. The window averages
are calculated for each point where the center of the window is moved stepwise
across the vector. The window has an adjustable size, and the step size can also be customized.
}
\details{
The sliding window average is computed by taking the mean of values within a specified
window size around each central value. For the boundary regions (near the start and end), the function
retains the original values without applying the moving average.

The cumulative sum of the input vector (\code{ratio}) is computed for efficient window sum calculation.
Boundary handling ensures that the first and last `window-1` data points remain unaltered.
