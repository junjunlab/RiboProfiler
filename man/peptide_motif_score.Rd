\title{Calculate Peptide Motif Scores}
\usage{
peptide_motif_score(
  object,
  codon_exp_file = NULL,
  sample_name = NULL,
  occurrence_threshold = 100,
  ...
)

\S4method{peptide_motif_score}{ribosomeObj}(
  object,
  codon_exp_file = NULL,
  sample_name = NULL,
  occurrence_threshold = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{ribosomeObj object.}

\item{codon_exp_file}{A vector of file paths to codon expression data files.}

\item{sample_name}{A vector of sample names corresponding to each codon expression file.}

\item{occurrence_threshold}{An integer specifying the minimum occurrence threshold for peptide motifs.}

\item{...}{Useless args.
Default is 50.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value, but creates output files in a 'peptide_motif' directory.
        Each output file is named '[sample_name]_tripeptide_occupancy.txt'.
}
\description{
This function calculates peptide motif scores based on amino acid sequences and codon expression data.
It uses a Python script to perform the calculations and saves the results for each sample.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
  1. Creates a 'peptide_motif' directory if it doesn't exist.
  2. Sources a Python script 'peptideMotifScore.py' from the RiboProfiler package.
  3. For each codon expression file:
     - Calls the Python function to calculate peptide motif scores.
     - Saves the results in the 'peptide_motif' directory.
     - Prints a message indicating the file has been processed.
